# RockPaperScissors
A Rock Paper Scissors game development project.

## How To Play 
The classic game is pretty simple. It is a hand game usually played between two people. 
- Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstreched hand:

    - Rock  - a fist
    - Paper - an open hand
    - Scissors - a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V

- A winner is dettermined based on the rules below;

    - Rock crushes Scissors 
    - Scissors cuts Paper
    - Paper covers Rock

- If both palyers choose the same shape (eg. Rock to Rock, Paper to Paper, and Scissors to SCissors), it's a tie and the game can be played again.

It is often used in some cases for decision-making or a game of chance.
